## Data for illumination analysis

Data used for illumination analysis are 2 raw (StreamPix Sequence v.5) 500 frames recordings, which are prohibitevely large to store on GitHub (2.0 and 3.3 GB) recorded from backlit and Retroreflective screen based systems respectively.

These two recordings are uploaded and publicly available on Figshare portal (doi: [10.6084/m9.figshare.8534057](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8534057)).
